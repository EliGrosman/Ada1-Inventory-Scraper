# Ada1ModScraper

A python script that fetches Ada-1's current inventory in Destiny 2.

## Setup

Out of the box, this script is set up for a MySQL database running on the local machine with the name 'adamods'. 
You can either create a database to match this configuration or make adjustments as needed to match your system.

You will also need a Bungie API application in order to access Ada's mods. You can register an application [here](https://www.bungie.net/en/Application). I recommend setting your OAuth Client Type to "Confidential".
After creating your application, take note of your API Key, OAuth client_id, and OAuth client_secret. You will need these later.
